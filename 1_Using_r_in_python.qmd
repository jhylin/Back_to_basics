This is something I've always wanted to try, that is using both R and Python in one place so here it is. 

Steps:

1. Install R with version at least 4.0 or above, and Python with version at least 3.7 or above (ref: https://rviews.rstudio.com/2022/05/25/calling-r-from-python-with-rpy2/).

2. Install R's language server as shown below.

```{r}
install.packages("languageserver")
```

3. Install R extension for VS Code (because I'm using VS Code but I think there is a very similar IDE called Positron created by Posit which may be easier to use for this case).

4. Install [rpy2 package](https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2).

5. I'll have to try to show and run both R and Python code below **to be done**
